<p>Moderators also have the ability to split posts from a topic. This can be useful if certain discussions have spawned a new idea worthy of its own thread, thus needing to be split from the original topic. Splitting posts involves moving individual posts from an existing topic to a new topic. You may do this by using the <span class="guilabel">Quick MOD Tools</span> area beneath the topic you want to split or from the <a href="moderator_mcp.php" title="4.5. The Moderator Control Panel (MCP)">Moderator Control Panel</a> within the topic.</p><p>While splitting, you may choose a title for the new topic, a different forum for the new topic, and also a different icon. You may also override the default board settings for the amount of posts to be displayed per page. The <span class="guilabel">Splitting from the selected post</span> option will split all posts from the checked post, to the last post. The <span class="guilabel">Splitting selected posts</span> option will only split the current selected posts. </p>
