This can be achieved by using the <span class="guilabel">Quick MOD Tools</span> area beneath the topic you want to duplicate, or through the <a href="moderator_mcp.php" title="4.5. The Moderator Control Panel (MCP)">Moderator Control Panel</a>  when viewing the forum. From this, you simply select the destination forum you wish to duplicate the topic to. Click <span class="guilabel">Yes</span> to duplicate the topic.</p>
