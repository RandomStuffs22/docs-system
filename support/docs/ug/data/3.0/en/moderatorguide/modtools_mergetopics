<p>In phpBB3, it is now possible to merge topics together, in addition to splitting topics. This can be useful if, for example, two separate topics are related and involve the same discussion. The merging topics feature allows existing topics to be merged into one another.</p><p>To merge topics together, start by locating selection menu beneath the topic in question, which brings you to the <a href="moderator_mcp.php" title="4.5. The Moderator Control Panel (MCP)">Moderator Control Panel</a>. From here, you need to enter the topic ID of the topic you want to move the posts to. You can click <span class="guilabel">Select topic</span> to see a list of the topics available and specify which. Checking the <span class="guilabel">Mark all</span> section will select all the posts in the current topic and allow moving to the existing topic. The posts merged into the new topic will retain their existing timestamp (e.g. they will not appear at the end of the topic they are being merged to, but will be sorted based on their timestamp).</p>
