<p>Rather than just merging topics together, you can also merge specific posts into any other topic.</p><p>To merge specific posts into another topic, start by locating the selection menu beneath the topic, and get to the <a href="moderator_mcp.php" title="4.5. The Moderator Control Panel (MCP)">Moderator Control Panel</a>. From here, you need to enter the topic ID of the topic you want to move the posts to. You can click <span class="guilabel">Select topic</span> to see a list of the topics available and specify which. Select the posts which you wish to merge from the current topic, into the existing topic. The posts merged into the new topic will retain their existing timestamp (e.g. they will not appear at the end of the topic they are being merged to, but will be sorted based on their timestamp).</p>
