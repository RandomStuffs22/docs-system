<p>Unlike phpBB2, phpBB3 now allows users to report a post, for reasons the board administrator can define within the <a href="../adminguide/admin_control_panel.php" title="3.1. The Administration Control Panel">Administration Control Panel</a>. If a user finds a post unsuitable for any reason, they may report it using the <span class="guilabel">Report Post</span> button beside the offending message. This report is then displayed within the Moderator Control Panel where the Administrator or Moderators can view, close, or delete the report.</p><p>When viewing a forum with post reports within topics, the topic title will be accompanied by a red exclamation icon. This alerts the administrator(s) or moderators that there a post has been reported. When viewing topics, reported posts are accompanied by a red exclamation and text. Clicking this icon or text will bring them to the Reported Posts section of the Moderator Control Panel.</p><p>For further information regarding the Moderator Control Panel, see <a href="moderator_mcp.php" title="4.5. The Moderator Control Panel (MCP)">Section 4.5, “The Moderator Control Panel (MCP)”</a>.</p>
