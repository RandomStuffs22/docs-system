Attachments are files that can be attached to posts, like e-mail attachments. Certain restrictions, set by the board administrator, control what users can attach. You can set these restrictions via the <span class="guimenuitem">Attachment Settings</span> page.</p><p>For more information, see the section on <a href="acp_attach_settings.php" title="3.4.6. Attachment Settings">configuring your board's attachment settings</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><span xmlns="" id="acp_general_settings"/>3.2.1.2. Board Settings</h4></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">dhn</span></h3></div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">MennoniteHobbit</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><p>The <span class="guimenuitem">Board Settings</span> allow you to change many settings that govern your board. These settings include important things such as the name of your forum! There are two main groups of board settings: the general <span class="guilabel">Board Settings</span>, and <span class="guilabel">Warnings</span> settings.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Board Settings</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p>The very first board setting you can edit is perhaps the most important setting of them all: the name of your board. Your users identify your board with this name. Put the name of your site into the <span class="guilabel">Site Name</span> text field and it will be shown on the header of the default style; it will be the prefix to the window title of your browser.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Site Description</span> is the slogan or tagline of your forum. It will appear below the <span class="guilabel">Site Name</span> on the default style's header.</p></li><li><p>If you need to close your whole forum to do maintenance work, for instance, you can do it by using the <span class="guilabel">Disable Board</span> switch. To temporarily disable your board, select<span class="guilabel">Yes</span>. This will keep any members of your forum who are not administrators or moderators from accessing your board. They will either see a default message instead of the forum, or a message that you create. You can add your own custom message that will be displayed when your board is disabled in the text box below the <span class="guilabel">Disable board</span> radio buttons. Administrators and moderators will still be able to browse forums and use their specific control panels when the board is disabled.</p></li><li><p>You also need to set the <span class="guilabel">Default Language</span> of your board. This is the language that guests will see when they visit your board. You can allow registered users to choose other languages. By default, the only language installed is <span class="guilabel">English [GB]</span>, but you can <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/languages" target="_top">download more languages on the phpBB website</a> and install them on your board. Find out more about working with languages in the <a href="acp_system_language.php" title="3.10.4. Language Packs">section on Language Pack configuration</a>.</p></li><li><p>You can also configure your board's default date format. phpBB3 has a few basic date formats that you can set your board to use; if these are not sufficient and you would like to customise your board's date format, choose <span class="guimenuitem">Custom</span> from the <span class="guilabel">Date format</span> selection menu. Then, in the text box besides it, type in the format you would like to use. This is the same as the <a href="http://www.php.net/date" target="_top">PHP date() function</a>.</p></li><li><p>Along with setting your board's default date format, you can also set your board's preferred timezone. The timezones available in the <span class="guilabel">System timezone</span> selection menu are all based on relative <span class="acronym">UTC</span> (for most intents and purposes, it is <span class="acronym">GMT</span>, or Greenwich Mean Time) times. You may also choose whether or not your board utilises Daylight Savings Time by selecting the appropriate radio button next to the <span class="guilabel">Enable Daylight Savings time</span> option.</p></li><li><p>You can also set your board's default style. The board will appear to your guests and members in the <span class="guilabel">Default Style</span>. In the standard phpBB installation, two styles are available: prosilver and subsilver2. You can either allow users to select another style than the default by selecting <span class="guilabel">No</span> in the <span class="guilabel">Override User Style</span> setting or disallow it. Please visit the <a href="acp_styles.php" title="3.8. Styles">styles section</a> to find out how to add new styles and where to find some.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Warnings</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p>Moderators can send warnings to users that break the forum rules. The value of <span class="guilabel">Warning Duration</span> defines the number of days a warning is valid until it expires. All positive integers are valid values. For more about warnings, please read <a href="../moderatorguide/moderator_mcp.php" title="4.5. The Moderator Control Panel (MCP)">Section 4.5, “The Moderator Control Panel (MCP)”</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><span xmlns="" id="acp_board_features"/>3.2.1.3. Board Features</h4></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">dhn</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><p>Through the <span class="guimenuitem">Board Features</span> section, you can enable or disable several features board-wide. Note that any feature you disable here will not be available on your forum, even if you give your users permissions to use them.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><span xmlns="" id="acp_board_avatars"/>3.2.1.4. Avatar Settings</h4></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">dhn</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><p>Avatars are generally small, unique images a user can associate with themselves. Depending on the style, they are usually displayed below the user name when viewing topics. Here you can determine how users can define their avatars.</p><p>There are three different ways a user can add an avatar to their profile. The first way is through an avatar gallery you provide. Note that there is no avatar gallery available in a default phpBB installation. The <span class="guilabel">Avatar Gallery Path</span> is the path to the gallery images. The default path is <span class="guilabel">images/avatars/gallery</span>. The gallery folder does not exist in the default installation so you have to add it manually if you want to use it.</p><p>The images you want to use for your gallery need to be in a folder inside the gallery path. Images directly in the gallery path won't be recognised.</p><p>The second approach to avatars is through <span class="guilabel">Remote Avatars</span>. This are simply images linked from another website. Your members can add a link to the image they want to use in their profile. To give you some control over the size of the avatars you can define the minimum and maximum size of the images. The disadvantage of <span class="guilabel">Remote Avatars</span> is that you are not able to control the file size.</p><p>The third approach to avatars is through <span class="guilabel">Avatar Uploading</span>. Your members can upload an image form their local system which will be stored on your server. They will be uploaded into the <span class="guilabel">Avatar Storage Path</span> you can define. The default path is <span class="guilabel">images/avatars/upload</span> and does already exist after installation. You have to make sure that it is <em class="glossterm">server-writable</em>. The file format of the images has to be either gif, jpeg, or png, and the avatars will be automatically checked for their file and image size after the upload. You can adjust the <span class="guilabel">Maximum Avatar File Size</span> and images that are bigger than the allowed value will be discarded.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><span xmlns="" id="acp_board_pms"/>3.2.1.5. Private Messaging</h4></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">dhn</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><p><em class="glossterm">Private Messages</em> are a way for registered members to communicate privately through your board without the need to fall back to e-mail or instant messaging. </p><p>You can disable this feature with the <span class="guilabel">Private Messaging</span> setting. This will keep the feature turned off for the whole board. You can disable private messages for selected users or groups with <a href="acp_permissions.php" title="3.7. Permission Overload">Permissions</a>. Please see the <a href="acp_permissions.php" title="3.7. Permission Overload">Permissions section</a> for more information. </p><p>Olympus allows users to create own personal folders to organise Private Messages. The <span class="guilabel">Maximum private message folders</span> setting defines the number of message folders they can create. The default value is 4. You can disable the feature with setting value to 0. </p><p><span class="guilabel">Max Private Messages Per Box</span> sets the number of Private Messages each folder can contain. The default value is <span class="guilabel">50</span>, Set it to 0 to allow unlimited messages per folder. </p><p>If you limit the number of messages users can store in their folders, you need to define a default action that is taken once a folder is full. This can be changed in the "Full Folder Default Action" list. The oldest message gets deleted or the new message will be held back until the folder has place for it. Note that users will be able to choose this for themselves in their PM options and this setting only changes the default value they face. This will not override the action a user chosen. </p><p>When sending a private message, it is still possible to edit the message until the recipient reads it. After a sent private message has been read, editing the message is no longer possible. To limit the time a message can be edited before the recipient reads it, you can set the <span class="guilabel">Limit Editing Time</span>. The default value is 0, which allows editing until the message is read. Note that you can disallow users or groups to edit Private Messages after sending through <a href="acp_permissions.php" title="3.7. Permission Overload">Permissions</a>. If the permission to edit messages is denied, it will override this setting. </p><p>The <span class="guilabel">General Options</span> allow you to further define the functionality of Private Messages on your board.
