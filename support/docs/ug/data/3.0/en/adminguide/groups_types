<p>There are two types of groups:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Pre-defined groups</span></dt><dd><p>These are groups that are available by default in phpBB 3.0. You <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> delete them, as the board needs them for various features. You can still change their attributes (description, colour, rank, avatar, and so forth) and group leaders. Users that register to your board are automatically added to the predefined group "Registered Users", for instance. Do not try to remove them manually through the database, or your board will no longer function properly.
						
							</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Administrators</span></dt><dd><p>This usergroup contains all of the administrators on your board. All founders are administrators, but not all administrators are founders. You can control what administrators can do by managing this group.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Bots</span></dt><dd><p>This usergroup is meant for search engine bots. phpBB 3.0 has the ability to overcome the common problems that search engine spiders encounter when spidering your board. For more information on managing settings for each bot, see the Spiders and Bots section.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Global Moderators</span></dt><dd><p>Global moderators are moderators that have moderator permissions for every forum in your board. You can edit what permissions these moderators have by managing this group.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Guests</span></dt><dd><p>Guests are visitors to your board who aren't logged in. You can limit what guests can do by managing this usergroup.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Registered Users</span></dt><dd><p>Registered users are a big part of your board. Registered users have already registered on your board. To control what registered users can do, manage this usergroup.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Registered COPPA Users</span></dt><dd><p>Registered COPPA users are basically the same as registered users, except that they fall under the <span class="acronym">COPPA</span>, or Child Online Privacy Protection Act, law, meaning that they are under the age of 13 in the U.S.A. Managing the permissions this usergroup has is important in protecting these users. <span class="acronym">COPPA</span> doesn't apply to users living outside of the U.S.A. and can be disabled altogether.</p></dd></dl></div><p>
							
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">User defined groups</span></dt><dd><p>The groups you create by yourself are called "User defined groups". These groups are similar to groups in 2.0. You may create as many as you want, remove them, set group leaders, and change their attributes (description, colour, rank, avatar, and so forth).</p></dd></dl></div><p>The <span class="guimenuitem">Manage Groups</span> section in the <span class="acronym">ACP</span> shows you separated lists of both your "User defined groups" and the "Pre-defined groups".</p>
