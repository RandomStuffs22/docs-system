<p>Forums are nothing without content. Content is created and posted by your users; as such, it is very important to have the right posting settings that control how the content is posted. You can reach this section by clicking the <span class="guimenuitem">Posting</span> navigation tab.</p><p>The first page you are greeted with after getting to the <span class="guimenuitem">Posting Settings</span> section is <span class="guilabel">BBCodes</span>. The other available subsections are divided into two main groups: <span class="guilabel">Messages</span> and <span class="guilabel">Attachments</span>. <span class="guimenuitem">Private message settings</span>, <span class="guimenuitem">Topic icons</span>, <span class="guimenuitem">Smilies</span>, and <span class="guimenuitem">Word censoring</span> are message-related settings. <span class="guimenuitem">Attachment settings</span>, <span class="guimenuitem">Manage extensions</span>, <span class="guimenuitem">Manage extension groups</span>, and <span class="guimenuitem">Orphaned attachments</span> are attachment-related settings.</p>
