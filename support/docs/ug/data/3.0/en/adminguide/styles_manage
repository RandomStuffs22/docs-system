<p>After you choose a style and you are ready to install it, unpack it on your PC and upload the directory with the style to your board's server. Make sure that the directory you upload to the server's <code class="filename">styles</code> contains the <code class="filename">template</code>, <code class="filename">theme</code> and <code class="filename">imageset</code> directories. The only exception is when a style has its template, theme or imageset based on another one, you will however be informed of that when you download the style. Having the dependent style component installed is required to install such a style.</p><p>Since you have uploaded all the necessary files, you can continue to install your style. Go to the <span class="guilabel">Styles</span> tab in the ACP. You should see a table containing several items - the preinstalled prosilver style, subsilver2, and any of your uploaded styles. The list is divided into two parts, the first one contains styles that are installed on the board and the second one contains styles that were uploaded, but not installed. If you want to install your downloaded style, click the <span class="guilabel">Install</span> link next to its title.</p><p>After you click <span class="guilabel">Install</span>, you will be asked about two options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="guilabel">Active</span>: If set to No, the style will not be available for users and only the admin will be able to preview it through the ACP.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Make default style</span>: This will set the style as the default one for the board, making it the style that new users and guests see. For more about setting the default style, read <a href="acp_general_config.php#acp_general_settings" title="3.2.1.2. Board Settings">Section 3.2.1.2, “Board Settings”</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>When you are finished, just click <span class="guilabel">Submit</span>.</p><p>At this moment, you should know how to install a new style. However, there are some links and features on the Styles overview page that we have missed. They are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="guilabel">Details</span>: This link will take you to the details of style, where you can change its name, author, the style components it uses and determine if the style is active or not.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Activate/Deactivate</span>: Pretty clear without an explanation, this link allows you to switch the style on and off very quickly and easily.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Export</span>: This will offer the style for download with any of its components. You will be able to choose between downloading the file to your PC or storing in in the store folder on your server. This feature is useful when you want to move your board and want to have the whole style packed up so you can use it in another place.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Delete</span>: If you or your users do not like the style anymore, use this link. When you delete a style, you will be requested to choose another style which will be set for users using the deleted one. Choose that style in <span class="guilabel">Replace style with</span> and click <span class="guilabel">Delete</span> to complete the process. If you delete a style, no files will be touched, the style will appear in the <span class="guilabel">Uninstalled styles</span> section.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Preview</span>: This is a very useful and powerful feature for administrators. If you click this link, you will be taken to the board and the style you have selected will be applied - this is great when you want to see if the style looks good on your board and you want to make sure you should activate it. This feature can be used even with deactivated styles. The style ID is passed through the URL, so you can browse through the board and see any page you need.</p></li></ul></div>
