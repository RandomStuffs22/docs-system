<p>If you allow your users to post attachments, it is important to be able to control your board's attachments settings. Here, you can configure the main settings for attachments and the associated special categories. When you are done configuring your board's attachments settings, click <span class="guilabel">Submit</span>.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Attachment Settings</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="guilabel">Allow attachments</span>: If you want attachments to be enabled on your board, select <span class="guilabel">Yes</span>.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Allow attachments in private messages</span>: If you want to enable attachments being posted in private messages, select <span class="guilabel">Yes</span>.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Upload directory</span>: The directory that attachments will be uploaded to.

You can further configure secure downloads once you have enabled them here; the secure downloads-specific settings are located in the <span class="guilabel">Define allowed IPs/Hostnames</span> and <span class="guilabel">Remove or un-exclude allowed IPs/hostnames</span> forms at the bottom of the page.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Allow/Deny list</span>: This allows you to configure the default behaviour when secure downloads are enabled. A whitelist (<span class="guilabel">Allow</span>) only allows <em class="glossterm">IP address</em>es or hostnames to access downloads, while a blacklist (<span class="guilabel">Deny</span>) allows all users except those who have an <em class="glossterm">IP address</em> or hostname located on the blacklist. <span class="emphasis"><em>This setting only applies if secure downloads are enabled.</em></span></p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Allow empty referrer</span>: Secure downloads are based on referrers.This setting controls if downloads are allowed for those omitting the referrer information. <span class="emphasis"><em>This setting only applies if secure downloads are enabled.</em></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Image Category Settings</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="guilabel">Display images inline</span>: How image attachments are displayed.

This is useful for particularly large images that are posted.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Imagemagick path</span>: If you have Imagemagick installed and would like to set your board to use it, specify the full path to your Imagemagick convert application. An example is <code class="filename">/usr/bin/</code>.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Maximum image dimensions</span>: The maximum size of image attachments, in pixels. If you would like to disable dimension checking (and thereby allow image attachments of any dimensions), set each value to 0.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Image link dimensions</span>: If an image attachment is larger than these dimensions (in pixels), a link to the image will be displayed in the post instead.
