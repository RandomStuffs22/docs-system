<p>Modules are used the form the structure and content of the <span class="acronym">UCP</span>, <span class="acronym">MCP</span> and <span class="acronym">ACP</span>. Individual modules can be optionally disabled and it is possible to reorganize them into a different structure. Modules for the User Control Panel and the Moderator Control panel have a Category » Module two-level structure, while the Administration modules have three levels: Category (tabs at the top) » Category (headers on the left-hand side) » Module (individual sections).</p><p>Very often, MODs that have controllable features add modules to the ACP to allow comfortable editing of various settings.</p><p>To create a module category, use the text field next to the <span class="guilabel">Create new module</span> button. Enter the category title, click the button and on the next page ensure that the <span class="guilabel">Module type</span> is <span class="guilabel">Category</span>, the module is <span class="guilabel">enabled</span> and that the <span class="guilabel">Module parent</span> is set correctly. After you create a category, you can browse to it through the list of modules and add a specific module that is saved in a file. Modules are saved in the appropriate directory (acp/, mcp/ or /ucp) contained in the <code class="filename">includes/</code> directory.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>By disabling the Module Management module, it is possible to cut yourself off from the ACP and other control panels.
