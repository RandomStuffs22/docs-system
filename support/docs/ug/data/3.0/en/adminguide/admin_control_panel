<p>Even more so than its predecessor, phpBB 3.0 "Olympus" is highly configurable. You can tune, adjust, or turn off almost all features. To make this load of settings as accessible as possible, we redesigned the Administration Control Panel (ACP) completely. </p><p>Click on the <span class="guilabel">Administration Control Panel</span> link on the bottom of the default forum style to visit the <span class="acronym">ACP</span>.</p><p>The <span class="acronym">ACP</span> has seven different sections by default with each containing a number of subsections. We will discuss each section in this Admin Guide. </p><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_acp_index"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.1. Administration Control Panel Index</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/admin_guide/acp_index.png" alt="Administration Control Panel Index"/><div class="caption"><p>The Administration Control Panel Index, the home of managing your phpBB board.
