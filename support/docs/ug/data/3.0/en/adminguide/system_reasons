<p>phpBB has a feature that allows you to put new posts in queue, where the post waits until it is approved or denied by a moderator, this can be set with permissions or in the <span class="guilabel">Post settings</span> for users which do not have enough posts. If a moderator chooses to deny a post in the queue, he has an option to specify a reason for the denial. The predefined options from which he can choose are specified here. These reasons are also offered to users reporting a post on the board.</p><p>For more information about queue moderation, see <a href="../moderatorguide/mcp_queue.php" title="4.5.1. Moderation queue">Section 4.5.1, “Moderation queue”</a>.</p><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_denial_reasons"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.13. Report/denial reasons page</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/admin_guide/denial_reasons.png" alt="Report/denial reasons page"/><div class="caption"><p>This is the page from which you can manage reasons shown when denying or reporting a post. Four default reasons present in a standard phpBB installation are shown. The fifth one is added manually and is not localised, this can be achieved by specifying an identifier in the <span class="guilabel">Reason title</span> containing only letters and underscores and then adding localised titles and reasons in the language file called <code class="filename">mcp.php</code> located in the <code class="filename">language/</code> directory. The predefined reasons are at the bottom of the file, you need to add your reason in the same way as the others are saved. When you localise a reason, it is shown in the correct translation for each language pack used on the board.</p></div></div></div>
