<p>In phpBB 3.0, there are three forum types. A forum can be a normal forum where people can post in, a category that contains forums, or it can be a simple link.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Forum</span></dt><dd><p>In a forum people can post their topics.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Link</span></dt><dd><p>The forum list displays a forum link like a normal forum. But instead of linking to a forum, you can point it to a URL of your choice.
