<p>phpBB 3.0 is very customisable. Styling is one aspect of this customisability. Being able to manage the styles your board uses is important in keeping an interesting board.

Each style entry in the database contains a link to the Style Demo, to show a live example of the style in use.</p></dd></dl></div><p>
