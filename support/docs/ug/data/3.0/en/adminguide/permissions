<p>On your board, you will need to control what users can and cannot do. With the flexible and detailed system that Olympus provides, you have very extensive possibilities of specifying and managing user and group permissions. There are basically two type of permissions - <span class="guilabel">Global permissions</span>, which apply to the whole board or are not related to forums and posts, and <span class="guilabel">Forum based permissions</span>, which can be used to control specific permissions for each forum.</p><p>To understand how to set permissions and to know how to use the interface, it is important to recognize the different types of permissions and tools that the <span class="guilabel">Permission</span> tab in the <span class="acronym">ACP</span> provides:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Global Permissions</span></dt><dd><p>These affect the whole board and are not bound to specific forums. They include user permissions, which limit the use of the <span class="acronym">UCP</span>, searching, private messaging, using of avatars/signatures etc. Administrator permissions are also set here, as they are Global.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Forum Based Permissions</span></dt><dd><p>These permissions are set for each forum/user or group combination individually. They can be divided into two types: User permissions and Moderator permissions. The first control if a user or group can see the forum, post in it, and so on, while the Moderator permissions control if the user or group can do moderator-related actions in it.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Permission Roles</span></dt><dd><p>In order to ease setting of permissions, you can create roles, that have a pre-defined set of permissions and which you can then assign to users or groups. phpBB already prepared some predefined roles for you to use - e.g., in forum based permissions, you can make each user a <span class="guilabel">Standard Moderator</span>, <span class="guilabel">Full Moderator</span> or <span class="guilabel">Limited Moderator</span>, etc. If you didn't have roles, you would have to set every single permission individually for each user.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Permission Masks</span></dt><dd><p>In this section, you do not set or change anything, but you can view the final permissions a user or group has depending on your settings in the other sections. This feature is particularly useful when you need to debug your permissions and for example, you cannot find out why someone doesn't have the permission you want him to have.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_quick_permissions_types_admin"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.7. Global and local permissions</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/quick_start_guide/permissions_types.png" alt="Global and local permissions"/><div class="caption"><p>Global and local permissions</p></div></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><span xmlns="" id="user_group_permission_note"/>Note</h3><p>Each permission can be assigned to a group or a user. We recommend you to use group permissions when possible - a simple example why: When you want to add a moderator to a forum, instead of assigning individual moderator permissions for each forum to him, you will just add him to the group which already has those permissions.</p></div><p>When setting permissions, you will encounter three possible values - NO, YES and NEVER, with NO as the default value for each permission. If you set a YES, it overrides the NO, however, if the permissions is set to NEVER, you cannot override it by setting it to YES in another place. If you still have problems understanding this system, see the Permissions Masks section.</p>
