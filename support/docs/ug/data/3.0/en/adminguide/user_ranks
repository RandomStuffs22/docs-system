<p>Ranks are special titles that can be applied to forum users. As an administrator, it is up to you to create and manage the ranks that exist on your board. The actual names for the ranks are completely up to you; it's usually best to tailor them to the main purpose of your board.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When assigning a special rank name to a user, remember that no permissions are associated. For example, if you create a "Support Moderator" rank and assign it to a user, that user will not automatically get moderator permissions. You must assign the user the special permissions separately.</p></div><p>To manage your board's ranks, login to your <span class="acronym">ACP</span>, click on the <span class="guimenuitem">Users and Groups</span> tab, and then click on the <span class="guimenuitem">Manage ranks</span> link located in the left-hand menu.

Fill in the first field <span class="guilabel">Rank title</span> with the name of the rank. If you uploaded an image you want to attribute to the rank into the <code class="filename">/images/ranks/</code> folder, you can select an image from the selection menu. The last setting you can set is if you want the rank to be a "special" rank. Special ranks are ranks that administrators assign to users; they are not automatically assigned to users based on their postcount. If you selected <span class="guilabel">No</span>, then you can fill in the <span class="guilabel">Minimum posts</span> field with the minimum number of posts your users must have before getting assigned this rank. When you are done, click the <span class="guilabel">Submit</span> button to add this new rank.</p><p>To edit a rank's current settings, locate the rank's row, and then click on its "Edit" button located in the <span class="guilabel">Action</span> column.</p><p>To delete a rank, locate the rank's row, and then click on its "Delete" button located in the <span class="guilabel">Action</span> column.
