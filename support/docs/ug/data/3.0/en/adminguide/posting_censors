<p>On some forums, a certain level of appropriate, profanity-free speech is required. Like phpBB2, phpBB3 continues to offer word censoring. Words that match the patterns set in the <span class="guilabel">Word censoring</span> panel will automatically be censored with text that you, the admin, specify. To manage your board's word censoring, click <span class="guimenuitem">Word censoring</span>.</p><p>To add a new word censor, click <span class="guilabel">Add new word</span>. There are two fields: <span class="guilabel">Word</span> and <span class="guilabel">Replacement</span>. Type in the word that you want automatically censored in the <span class="guilabel">Word</span> text field. (Note that you can use wildcards (*).) Then, type in the text you want the censored word to be replaced with in the <span class="guilabel">Replacement</span> text field. Once you are done, click <span class="guilabel">Submit</span> to add the new censored word to your board.</p><p>To edit an existing word censor, locate the censored word's row. Click the "edit" icon located in that row, and proceed with changing the censored word's settings.</p>
