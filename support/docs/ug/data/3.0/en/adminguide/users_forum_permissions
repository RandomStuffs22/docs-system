<p>Along with editing your users' user account-related permissions, you can also edit their forum permissions, which relate to the forums in your board. Forum permissions are different from user permissions in that they are directly related and tied to the forums. <span class="guimenuitem">Users' forum permissions</span> allows you to edit your users' forum permissions. When doing so, you can only assign forum permissions to one user at a time.</p><p>To start editing a user's forum permissions, start by typing in the user's username into the <span class="guilabel">Find a member</span> text box. If you would like to edit the forum permissions that pertain to the anonymous user, check the <span class="guilabel">Select anonymous user</span> text box. Click <span class="guilabel">Submit</span> to continue.</p><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_acp_u_forum_permissions"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.6. Selecting forums for users' forum permissions</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/admin_guide/users_forum_permissions.png" alt="Selecting forums for users' forum permissions"/><div class="caption"><p>Selecting forums to assign forum permissions to users. In this example, the "Cats" and "Dogs" subforums (their parent forum is "Pets") are selected.

You now have two ways to assign forum permissions to the user: you may either select the forum(s) manually with a multiple selection menu, or select a specific forum or category, along with its associated subforums. Click <span class="guilabel">Submit</span> to continue with the forum(s) you have picked. Now, you should be greeted with the <span class="guilabel">Setting permissions</span> screen, where you can actually assign the forum permissions to the user. You should now select what kind of forum permissions you want to edit now; you may either edit the user's <span class="guimenuitem">Forum permissions</span> or <span class="guimenuitem">Moderator permissions</span>. Click <span class="guilabel">Go</span>. You should now be able to select the role to assign to the user for each forum you selected previously. If you would like to configure these permissions with more detail, click the <span class="guilabel">Advanced permissions</span> link located in the appropriate forum permissions box, and then update the permissions accordingly. When you are done, click <span class="guilabel">Apply all permissions</span> if you are in the <span class="guilabel">Advanced permissions</span> area, or click <span class="guilabel">Apply all permissions</span> at the bottom of the page to submit all of your changes on the page.</p>
