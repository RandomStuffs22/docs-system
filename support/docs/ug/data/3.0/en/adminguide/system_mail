<p>phpBB allows you to send an e-mail or message to every user on the board, which allows it in his <a href="../userguide/ucp_preferences.php" title="5.3.3. Preferences">board preferences</a>. The message can serve as a newsletter, notification about changes on the board etc. You can choose whether to send the e-mail to all users, a specific group or a list of specific users. The e-mail is sent from the administrator's e-mail address and all recipients are included in a BCC - Blind Carbon Copy.</p><p>On some hosts, sending a mass e-mail can be a problem, since sometimes the hosting company limits the number of e-mails that can be sent out at once. phpBB includes only 50 recipients per e-mail and sends another one for the next batch to prevent this, however, if you still are not able to send a mass e-mail, consult the situation with your hosting provider.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Composing a mass e-mail</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="guilabel">Send to group</span>: Select the group you want to send the e-mail too.
