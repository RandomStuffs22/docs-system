<p>phpBB uses a database to store all the data used on the board, including users, posts, topics etc. Backing up the database can be useful as a protective measure in case of any accidents which could cause data loss or damage to the database. If any accident like this would occur, you would have a possibility to restore the database to a previous state from the backup. You can use the backup tool to move your board to another host - you will make a backup on your current server and restore it on the new one to keep all data.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Database backup</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="guilabel">Backup type</span>: You can backup the whole database or you can either backup the <span class="guilabel">structure</span> or <span class="guilabel">data</span>.

When backing up a large database, you can exclude the search tables (do not forget to restore their structure) and recreate the search index on the new server.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>Use the CTRL and Shift keys together with your mouse to select individual tables.</p></div></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Database restore</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p>File select: You will be offered a list of database backups which are saved in the store folder.
