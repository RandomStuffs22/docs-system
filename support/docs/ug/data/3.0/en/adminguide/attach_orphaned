<p>Sometimes, attachments may be orphaned, which means that they exist in the specified files directory (to configure this directory, see the section on <a href="acp_attach_settings.php" title="3.4.6. Attachment Settings">attachment settings</a>), but aren't assigned to any post(s). This can happen when posts are deleted or edited, or even when users attach a file, but don't submit their post.</p><p>To manage orphaned attachments, click on <span class="guimenuitem">Orphaned attachments</span> on the left-hand menu once you're in the <span class="guimenuitem">Posting</span> settings section of the <em class="glossterm">ACP</em>. You should see a list of all orphaned attachments in the table, along with all the important information regarding each orphaned attachment.</p><p>You can assign an orphaned attachment to a specific post. To do so, you must first find the post's post ID. Enter this value into the <span class="guilabel">Post ID</span> column for the particular orphaned attachment. Enable <span class="guilabel">Attach file to post</span>, then click <span class="guilabel">Submit</span>.</p><p>To delete an orphaned attachment, check the orphaned attachment's <span class="guilabel">Delete</span> checkbox, then click <span class="guilabel">Submit</span>. Note that this cannot be undone.</p>
