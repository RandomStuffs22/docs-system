<p>phpBB3 introduces several new ways to search for users.</p><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="user_memberlist_sorting"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.4. Sorting the memberlist</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/user_guide/memberlist_sorting.png" alt="Sorting the memberlist"/><div class="caption"><p>Choosing an option to sort the memberlist by.</p></div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Sort By Username</span></dt><dd><p>If you want to find all members whose usernames start with a certain letter, then you may select the letter from the list of letters shown at the top of the memberlist. For instance, clicking "A" will display all usernames beginning with the letter A, while clicking "B" will list all usernames beginning with B. Clicking the hash (#) will display a list of usernames that do not begin with one of the twenty-six letters: in other words, numbers and other characters.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Sort By Column Headers</span></dt><dd><p>Each of the column headings are also sort links. That means you can click <span class="guilabel">Username</span>, <span class="guilabel">Rank</span>, <span class="guilabel">Posts</span>, <span class="guilabel">Website</span>, <span class="guilabel">Location</span>, <span class="guilabel">&gt;Joined</span>, or <span class="guilabel">Last Active</span> to sort by that group. Upon clicking this for the first time, the lists will be sorted in ascending order (meaning that usernames would be listed A to Z and joined date would be listed earliest to most recent.) If you want to order the list in descending order, wait until the page has loaded in ascending order and click the column heading you wish to order by for a second time.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Sort By Other Options</span></dt><dd><p>You may also sort the memberlist by using the dropdown boxes on the bottom of the page.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Find a Member Search Tool</span></dt><dd><p>You can narrow down your search results using the <span class="guilabel">Find a member</span> search function. This feature allows you to find members by their username, ICQ number, AIM, YIM, MSN Messenger/Windows Live Messenger address, join date, last active date, number of posts, IP address, and usergroup membership(s). All dates should be entered in the format YYYY-MM-DD (such as 2004-02-28 to represent February 28, 2004). The asterix (*) can be used as a wildcard for partial matches, such as entering "Ar*" into the username field to find all usernames beginning with Ar. Press the <span class="guilabel">Submit</span> button to begin the search, or the <span class="guilabel">Reset</span> button if you wish to clear all fields and start the search again.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The availability of the sort method selection boxes varies by style.</p></div>
