<p>Just like in your e-mail client, all <em class="glossterm">private messages</em> are stored in folders. Working with folders is similar to working with forums in phpBB 3.0. The <span class="guilabel">Inbox</span> is your default incoming message folder. All messages you receive will appear in here.</p><p><span class="guilabel">Sent messages</span> will appear in either the <span class="guilabel">Outbox</span> or the <span class="guilabel">Sent messages</span> folder. As long as the recipient(s) have not yet read the message, it will stay in the <span class="guilabel">Outbox</span>. As soon as someone reads the message it will be archived to the <span class="guilabel">Sent messages</span> folder. If the administrator allows it, you can edit messages after sending them as long as they are in the <span class="guilabel">Outbox</span> and the recipients have not yet read them.</p><p>Each folder, including <span class="guilabel">Sent messages</span> and <span class="guilabel">Outbox</span>, can hold a board-defined amount of messages. This is a global setting that only a board administrator can change. An info text displays the current number of allowed messages and the current percentage of space your messages are using at the top of each folder. If no restriction is displayed, you are allowed unlimited messages in each folder.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Please note that the total amount of messages allowed is a per-folder setting. You can have multiple folders which each allow 50 messages for instance. If you have 3 folders, your actual global limit is 150 messages, but each folder can only contain up to 50 messages by itself. It is not possible to merge folders and have one with more messages than the limit.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><span xmlns="" id="pm_folders_custom"/>5.5.3.1. Custom Folders</h4></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">dhn</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><p>If the administrator allows it, you can create your own custom <em class="glossterm">private message</em> folders in phpBB 3.0. To check whether you can add folders, visit the <span class="guimenuitem">Edit options</span> section of the <span class="guilabel">private message</span> area. </p><p>To add a new folder, enter the folder's name into the <span class="guilabel">Add folder</span> input box. If creation was successful, your new folder will appear at the bottom of the folder list. You can then use it like a normal message folder and move messages into it or set a filter (see the section on <a href="pm_filters.php" title="5.5.4. Message filters">Private Message Filters</a> for more information about filters) to automatically do it for you.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><span xmlns="" id="pm_folders_moving"/>5.5.3.2. Moving Messages</h4></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">dhn</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><p>It wouldn't make sense to have custom folders if you weren't able to move messages between them. To do exactly that, visit the folder from which you want to move the messages away. Select the messages you want to move, and use the <span class="guilabel">Moved marked</span> pull-down menu to select the destination folder.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Please note that if after the move, the destination folder would have more messages in it than the message limit allows, you will receive an error message and the move will be discarded.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><span xmlns="" id="pm_folders_marking"/>5.5.3.3. Message Markers</h4></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">dhn</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><p>Messages inside folders can have colour markings. Please refer to the <span class="guilabel">Message colours</span> legend to see what each colour means. The exact type of colouring depends on the used theme. Coloured messages can have four different meanings:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Marked message</span></dt><dd><p>You can set a message as marked with the <span class="guilabel">Mark as important</span> option from the pull-down menu.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Replied to message</span></dt><dd><p>If you reply to a message, the message will be marked as this. This way, you can keep hold of which messages still need your attention and which messages you have already replied to.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Message from a friend</span></dt><dd><p>If the sender of a message is in your friends list (see the section on <a href="ucp_friends_foes.php" title="5.3.4. Friends and Foes">Friends &amp; Foes</a> for more information), this colour will highlight the message.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Message from a foe</span></dt><dd><p>If the sender of a message is one of your foes, this colour will highlight this.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Please note that a message can only have one label, and it will always be the last action you take. If you mark a message as <span class="guilabel">important</span> and reply to it afterwards, for instance, the <span class="guilabel">replied to</span> label will overwrite the <span class="guilabel">important</span> label.</p></div></div>
