To view the UCP, click the 'User Control Panel' link that appears after logging in.</p><p>The UCP is separated into seven tabs: Overview, Private Messages, Profile, Preferences, Friends and Foes, Attachments, and Groups. Within each tab are several sub pages, accessed by clicking the desired link on the left side of the UCP interface. Some of these areas may not be available depending on the permissions set for you by the administrator.</p><p>Every page of the UCP displays your Friends List on the left side. To send a private message to a friend, click their user name.</p><p>TODO: Note that Private messaging will be discussed in its own section</p>
