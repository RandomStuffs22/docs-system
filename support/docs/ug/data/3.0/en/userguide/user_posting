<p>TODO: How to write a new post and how to reply. Special items like attachments or polls are subsections. Don't forget to mention the "someone has replied before you replied" feature, the topic review, and so forth. Topic icons, smilies, post options, usage of HTML ... it would probably best to add a screenshot with arrows to the different sections.</p><p>Posting is the primary purpose of bulletin boards. There are two main types of posts you can make: a topic or a reply. Selecting the <span class="guilabel">New Topic</span> button in a forum button will take you to the posting screen. After submitting your post, a new topic will appear in that forum with your post as the first displayed. Other users (and you as well) are now able to reply to your topic by using the <span class="guilabel">Post Reply</span> button. This will once again bring you to the posting screen, allowying you to enter your post.</p>
