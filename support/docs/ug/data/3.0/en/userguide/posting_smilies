<p>Smilies, or emoticons, are small images which can be inserted into your post to add expression emphasis. To use Smiles, certain characters are put together to get the desired output. For example, typing :) will insert [insert smilie here], ;) will insert [insert wink smilie here], etc. Other smilies require the format :texthere: to display. For example, :roll: will insert smilie whose eyes are rolling: [insert rolling smilie here], and :cry: will insert a smilie who is crying: [insert crying smilie here].</p><p>In many cases you can also select which smilie you'd like to insert by clicking its picture on the right side of the Post Content text box. When clicked, the smilie's characters will appear at the current location of the curser in the text box.</p><p>If you wish to be able to use these characters in your post, but not have them appear as smilies, please see <a href="posting_options.php" title="5.4.4. Post Options">Posting Options</a>.</p>
