<p>Now you have to create your administration user. This user will have full administration access and he will be the first user on your forum. All fields on this page are required. You can also set the default language of your forum on this page. In a vanilla (basic) phpBB 3.0 installation we only include <span class="guilabel">English [GB]</span>. You can download further languages from <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/languages/" target="_top">www.phpbb.com</a>, and add them later.</p>
