<p>phpBB3 Olympus ships with a number of default permission roles, that offer you a wide variety of options for setting permissions. Instead of having to check each radio button manually, you can select a predefined role in the <span class="guilabel">Role</span>pull down list. Each role has a detailed description, that will pop up when you hover your mouse over it. Submit your changes with <span class="guilabel">Apply Permissions</span> or <span class="guilabel">Apply All Permissions</span> when you are satisfied with them. That will set the permissions and you are done.</p><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_quick_permissions_roles"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.9. Permission roles</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/quick_start_guide/permissions_roles.png" alt="Permission roles"/><div class="caption"><p>Setting permissions with roles</p></div></div></div><p>But permission roles are not only a quick and easy way to set permissions, they are also a powerful tool for experienced board administrators to manage permissions on bigger boards. You can create your own roles and edit existing ones. Roles are dynamic, so when you edit a role, all groups and users that have the role assigned will automatically be updated.</p>
