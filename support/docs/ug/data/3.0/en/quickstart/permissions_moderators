<p>A quite common use case for permissions and roles are forum moderation. phpBB3 makes assigning users as moderators of forums really simple.</p><p>As you might have already guessed, moderation of specific forums is a local setting, so you can find <span class="guilabel">Forum Moderators</span> in the section for <span class="guilabel">Forum Based Permissions</span>. First of all, you will have to select for forum (or forums) you want to assign new moderators to. This form is divided into three areas. In the first one, you can select multiple forums (select multiple by holding down the CTRL button on your keyboard, or cmd (under MacOS X)), where the moderator settings you will set in the following form will only apply to these exact forums. The second area allows you to select only one forum but all the following settings will apply not only to this forum but also all its subforums. Finally, the third area's selection will only affect exactly this forum.</p><p>After selecting the forums and hitting <span class="guilabel">Submit</span>, you will be greeted by a form you should already be familiar with from one of the previous sections in this guide: <a href="quick_permissions_forum.php#img_quick_permissions_select" title="Figure 1.7. Select Groups">Figure 1.7, “Select Groups”</a>. Here you can select the users or groups that should get some kind of moderation power over the selected forums. So go ahead: Select some users and/or groups and hit the <span class="guilabel">Set Permissions</span> button.</p><p>In the next form you can choose, what moderator permissions the selected users/groups should receive. First of all, there are some predefined roles from which you can select:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Standard Moderator</span></dt><dd><p>A Standard Moderator can approve or disapprove, edit and delete posts, delete or close reports, but not necessarily change the owner of a post. This kind of moderator can also issue warnings and view details of a post.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Simple Moderator</span></dt><dd><p>A Simple Moderator can edit posts and close and delete reports and can also view post details.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Queue Moderator</span></dt><dd><p>As a Queue Moderator, you can only approve or disapprove posts that landed in the moderator queue and edit posts.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Full Moderator</span></dt><dd><p>Full Moderators can do everything moderation-related; they can even ban users.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_quick_permissions_moderator"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.10. The Forum Moderator's Permissions</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/quick_start_guide/permissions_moderator.png" alt="The Forum Moderator's Permissions"/><div class="caption"><p>Set the moderator's permissions</p></div></div></div><p>When you're done simply hit <span class="guilabel">Apply all Permissions</span>. All the permissions mentioned here can also be selected from the right side of the form to give you more granular options.</p>
