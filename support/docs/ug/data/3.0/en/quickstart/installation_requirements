<p>Please read the <a href="quick_requirements.php" title="1.1. Requirements">section on phpBB3's requirements</a> to find out more about the phpBB 3.0's minimum requirements.</p></div><p>The requirements list is the first page you will see after starting the installation. phpBB 3.0 automatically checks if everything that it needs to run properly is installed on your server. In order to continue the installation, you will need to have <span class="acronym">PHP</span> installed (the minimum version number is shown on the requirements page), and at least one database available to continue the installation. It is also important that all shown folders are available and have the correct permissions set. Please see the description of each section to find out if they are optional or required for phpBB 3.0 to run. If everything is in order, you can continue the installation by clicking the <span class="guilabel">Start Install</span> button.</p>
