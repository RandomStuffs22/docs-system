<p>phpBB 3.0 Olympus has an easy to use installation system that will guide you through the installation process.</p><p>After you have decompressed the phpBB3 archive and uploaded the files to the location where you want it to be installed, you need to enter the <span class="acronym">URL</span> into your browser to open the installation screen. The first time you point your browser to the <span class="acronym">URL</span> (<code class="uri">http://www.example.com/phpBB3</code> for instance), phpBB will detect that it is not yet installed and automatically redirect you to the installation screen.</p><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_quick_installation_intro"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.1. Introduction</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/quick_start_guide/installation_intro.png" alt="Introduction"/><div class="caption"><p>The introduction page of the installation system.</p></div></div></div>
