<p>If you want to enable or disable some of the basic features of your board, this is the place to go. Here you can allow and disallow for example username changes (<span class="guilabel">Allow Username changes</span>) or the creation of attachments (<span class="guilabel">Allow Attachments</span>). You can even disable <span class="acronym">BBCode</span> altogether (<span class="guilabel">Allow BBCode</span>).</p><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_quick_settings_features"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.4. Board Features</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/quick_start_guide/settings_features.png" alt="Board Features"/><div class="caption"><p>Enabling and disabling basic features with just 2 clicks</p></div></div></div><p>Disabling BBCode completely is a little bit to harsh for your taste but you don't want your users to abuse the signature field for tons of images? Simply set <span class="guilabel">Allow use of IMG BBCode Tag in user signatures</span> to "No". If you want to be a little bit more specific on what you want to allow and disallow in users' signatures, have a look at the "Signature Settings" form.</p><p>The "Board Features" form offers you a great way to control the features in an all-or-nothing way. If you want to get into the details on each feature, there is for everything also a separated form which let's you specify everything from the maximum number of characters allowed in a post (<span class="guilabel">Max characters per post</span> in "Post Settings") to how large a user's avatar can be (<span class="guilabel">Maximum Avatar Dimensions</span> in "Avatar Settings").</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>If you disable features, these will also be unavailable to users who would normally have them according to their respective permissions.
