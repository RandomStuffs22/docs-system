<p>This is the most important aspect of permissions. You need to understand this to properly work with them. There are three different values that a permission can take:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="guilabel">YES</span> will allow a permission setting <span class="emphasis"><em>unless</em></span> it is overwritten by a <span class="guilabel">NEVER</span>.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">NO</span> will be disallow a permission setting <span class="emphasis"><em>unless</em></span> it is overwritten by a <span class="guilabel">YES</span>.</p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">NEVER</span> will completely disallow a permission setting for a user. It <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> be overwritten by a <span class="guilabel">YES</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>The three values are important as it is possible for a user to have more than one permissions for the same setting through multiple groups. If the user is a member of the default "Registered Users" group and a custom group called "Senior Users" you created for your most dedicated members, both could have different permissions for seeing a forum. In this example you want to make a forum called "Good old times" only available to the "Senior Users" group, but don't want all "Registered Users" to see it. You will of course set the <span class="guilabel">Can see forum</span> permission to <span class="guilabel">Yes</span> for "Senior Users". But <span class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> set the permission to <span class="guilabel">Never</span> for "Registered Users". If you do this, "Senior Members" will not see the forum as the <span class="guilabel">Never</span> overrides any <span class="guilabel">Yes</span> they have. Leave the setting at <span class="guilabel">No</span> instead. <span class="guilabel">No</span> is a weak <span class="guilabel">Never</span> that a <span class="guilabel">Yes</span> can override.</p><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_quick_permissions_manual"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.8. Manual permissions</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/quick_start_guide/permissions_manual.png" alt="Manual permissions"/><div class="caption"><p>Setting permissions manually</p></div></div></div>
