<p>You now have to decide which database to use. See the <a href="quick_requirements.php" title="1.1. Requirements">Requirements section</a> for information on which databases are supported. If you do not know your database settings, please contact your hosting company and ask for them. You will not be able to continue without them. You need:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Database Type</span> - the database you will be using (e.g. mySQL, SQL server, Oracle)</p></li><li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Database server hostname or DSN</span> - the address of the database server.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Database server port</span> - the port of the database server (most of the time this is not needed).</p></li><li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Database name</span>- the name of the database on the server.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Database username</span> and <span class="guilabel">Database password</span> - the login data to access the database.</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>If you are installing using SQLite, you should enter the full path to your database file in the DSN field and leave the username and password fields blank. For security reasons, you should make sure that the database file is not stored in a location accessible from the web.</p></div><div class="figure"><span xmlns="" id="img_quick_installation_database"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.2. Database settings</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/support/docs/ug/images/3.0/quick_start_guide/installation_database.png" alt="Database settings"/><div class="caption"><p>The database settings screen, please make sure to have all the required data available</p></div></div></div><p>You don't need to change the <span class="guilabel">Prefix for tables in database</span> setting, unless you plan on using multiple phpBB installations on one database.

Now, phpBB 3.0 will test and verify the data you entered.</p><p>If you see a "<span class="guilabel">Could not connect to the database</span>" error, this means that you didn't enter the database data correctly and it is not possible for phpBB to connect. Make sure that everything you entered is in order and try again. Again, if you are unsure about your database settings, please contact your host.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>Remember that your database username and password are case sensitive. You must use the exact one you have set up or been given by your host</p></div><p>If you installed another version of phpBB before on the same database with the same prefix, phpBB will inform you and you just need to enter a different database prefix.</p><p>If you see the <span class="guilabel">Successful Connection</span> message, you can continue to the next step.</p>
