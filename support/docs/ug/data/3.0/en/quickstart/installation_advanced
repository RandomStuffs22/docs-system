<p>The <span class="guilabel">Advanced settings</span> allow you to set some parameters of the board configuration. They are optional, and you can always change them later if you wish. So if you are unsure of what these settings mean, ignore them and proceed to the final step to finish the installation.</p><p>If the installation was successful, you can now use the <span class="guilabel">Login</span> button to visit the <span class="guilabel">Administration Control Panel</span>. Congratulations, you have installed phpBB 3.0 successfully. But there is still a lot of work ahead!</p><p>If you are unable to get phpBB 3.0 installed even after reading this guide, please look at the <a href="quick_support.php" title="1.6. Obtaining support">support section</a> to find out where you can ask for further assistance. </p><p>At this point if you are upgrading from phpBB 2.0, you should refer to the <a href="../upgradeguide/index.php" title="Chapter 2. Upgrade Guide">upgrade guide</a> for further information.
