<p>In this step, phpBB will automatically try to write the configuration file. The forum needs the configuration to run properly. It contains all of the database settings, so without it, phpBB will not be able to access the database.</p><p>Usually, automatically writing the configuration file works fine. But in some cases it can fail due to wrong file permissions, for instance. In this case, you need to upload the file manually. phpBB asks you to <span class="guilabel">download</span> the config.php file and tells you what to do with it. Please read the instructions carefully. After you have uploaded the file, click <span class="guilabel">Done</span> to get to the last step. If <span class="guilabel">Done</span> returns you to the same page as before, and does not return a success message, you did not upload the file correctly.</p>
